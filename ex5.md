# Exercise 5: Compute Contexts

## Before You Start

Before you start this exercise, ensure that you have completed the [previous execise](ex4.md).

## Task 1: Use Cloud Compute Targets

The experiments you have created so far have consisted of code running on your Notebook VM. One of the great advantages of the cloud is the ability to scale processes dynamically by creating cloud compute on-demand and allocating processes to these cloud compute targets.

1. Start your Notebook VM and connect to **Jupyter** or **JupyterLab**.
2. In the **/azureml-primers/notebooks** folder, open the **05 - Compute Contexts.ipynb** notebook.
3. Read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.

> **Note**: If you intend to continue straight to the [next exercise](ex6.md), leave your Notebook VM running. If you're taking a break, you might want to close the Jupyter tabs and **Stop** your Notebook VM to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
