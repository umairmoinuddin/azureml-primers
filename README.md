# Azure Machine Learning Primers

This repo contains some hands-on exercises to get you started with Azure Machine Learning (*Azure ML*). You should complete the exercises in order.

## Assumed Knowledge

These exercises are designed to help data scientists learn how to use Azure ML to run data science workloads in the cloud. They are ***not*** designed to teach Python or machine learning concepts. If you are a data scientist or other software professional, and you are familiar with the following, then these exercises are for you:

- Python environments and package management (including *conda* and *pip*)
- Common Python libraries for data analysis (including *numpy*, *pandas*, and *matplotlib*)
- Machine Learning on Python (including a basic conceptual understanding of machine learning principles, and common ML frameworks - particularly *scikit-learn*)

## Exercises

This lab is designed to build incremental knowledge and skills by progressing through a series of exercises, each adding new Azure ML capabilities to a machine learning senario. The scenario is deliberately simple, and focuses on building a binary classification model using scikit-learn. This makes it easier to focus on the Azure ML concepts and techniques being explored without the distraction of complex data modeling. Despite the simplicity, the principles demonstrated in these exercises apply to more complex scenarios, including deep learning models based on frameworks like *TensorFlow*, *Keras*, and *PyTorch*.
