# Exercise 10: Model Interpretation

## Before You Start

Before you start this exercise, ensure that you have completed the [previous execise](ex9.md).

## Task 1: Interpret Models

As machine learning becomes more and more and more prevelant, the predictions made by models have greater influence over many aspects of our society. The ability to interpret and explain models is increasingly important, so that the rationale for the predictions made by machine learning models can be explained and justified, and any inadvertant bias in the model can be identified.

1. Start your Notebook VM and connect to **Jupyter** or **JupyterLab**.
2. In the **/azureml-primers/notebooks** folder, open the **10 - Model Interpretation.ipynb** notebook.
3. Read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.

> **Note**: If you intend to continue exploring Azure ML, leave your Notebook VM running. If you're finished, or just taking a break, you might want to close the Jupyter tabs and **Stop** your Notebook VM to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
