Although it's fairly common for data scientists to work with data on their local file system, in an enterprise environment it can be more effective to store the data in a central location where multiple data scientists can access it. In this exercise, you'll explore some Azure ML features that make it easier to work with data in a high-scale, collaborative environment.\n",
