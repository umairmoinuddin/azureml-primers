# Exercise 2: Getting Started with Experiments

## Before You Start

Before you start this exercise, ensure that you have completed the [previous execise](ex1.md).

## Task 1: Explore Experiments with the Azure ML SDK

Experiments are at the core of a data scientists work. In this task, you'll see how to use Azure ML to run experiments that process data to generate metrics and other analytical output.

1. Start your Notebook VM and connect to **Jupyter** or **JupyterLab**.
2. In the **/azureml-primers/notebooks** folder, open the **02 - Getting Started with Experiments.ipynb** notebook.
3. Read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.

> **Note**: If you intend to continue straight to the [next exercise](ex3.md), leave your Notebook VM running. If you're taking a break, you might want to close the Jupyter tabs and **Stop** your Notebook VM to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
